        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>I am a web developer in the making. I am astrophysicist and I love math, astronomy and physics. Web development is becoming my passion and I am looking forward to expand my knowledge in that area. I like to code and solve problems. I like creating nice, clean and intuitive user interfaces that are enjoyable for the user.</p>
        <p>I also quite like nature and sports that expose you to it. I was a skydiver in my teens and early twenties, and now I like to ride a mountain bicycle. I also like hiking and all sorts of wandering through the nature.</p>
        <p>For me, a web page should be like a beautiful natural landscape that I am able to create myself.</p>
        <p>If you like nature, you can check out <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/vojislav.grujic">my picasa gallery</a> while it still exists.</p>
